     The first activity I completed for this week's module was "What is the Internet?" I read a bunch of small articles that covered the topic. The article covered everything from what the Internet actually is by describing its definition to setting it up and its possible functions that are available to the user. I found the activity very usual and easy to navigate. As it is the first activity that I have completed, it gives me a basic understanding of the concepts I will learn in this class. In the near future, I am hoping to go into more detail about these ideas to have a clearer understanding of them. I will use the knowledge I have gathered from this activity in the near future as I am hoping it will help me in this course. Also, it will help me on a daily basis as I use the Internet every day. 

     For my second activity for this week's module I have completed was "What are keyboard shortcuts?". This activity was also an article, and it went over plenty of key combinations that are available for computer users to use. Going into this activity, I knew a couple of shortcuts that I use pretty often; however, I learned a lot of new ones I am hoping to get familiar with and use on a daily basis. I only knew some shortcuts with the CTRL button, and I did not even know ALT had quite a few shortcuts too! The information I have learned today is very important as it can help me be more efficient with my work. I can see myself using a couple already and am training to practice them in a routine. I am hoping to know all of these shortcuts in the future which could potentially be handy in my future education and possible employment.
